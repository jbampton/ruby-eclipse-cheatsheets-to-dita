# Eclipse cheat sheets (XML) to DITA with Ruby, XSLT, XPath, Nokogiri

This project uses Ruby, XSL and the Nokogiri gem to transform custom XML (Eclipse cheat sheets) into DITA.

The files default.rb and default.xsl build the parent Ditamap 'map.ditamap' in the 'output' directory and the 4 sub tasks in the 'output/dita' folder.

It uses Ruby to create the ditamap and Ruby and Nokogiri XSLT to create the sub task files.

I used RubyMine and OS X for development.  RubyMine is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Ruby and Rails projects and has Git functionality built in.

RubyMine is a very advanced code editor that is a commercial product from JetBrains.  I also like PyCharm and IntelliJ from JetBrains.

The 'cheatsheets-xml-test-data' comes from another open source project I worked on and they are best viewed inside Eclipse.

Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) is an XML data model for authoring and using DITA-OT you can publish those ideas.

The DITA standard is maintained by the OASIS DITA Technical Committee.

Eclipse is a more general purpose IDE written mainly in Java.
