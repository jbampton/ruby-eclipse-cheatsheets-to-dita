Eclipse cheat sheets (XML) to DITA with Ruby

This is a first attempt at using Ruby to transform custom XML into DITA.

The default.rb builds the Ditamap 'map.ditamap' in the 'output' directory.

More to come soon....

It uses Nokogiri to parse the cheat sheets (XML)

I used RubyMine for development.  It is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Ruby and Rails projects and has Git functionality built in.

RubyMine is a very advanced code editor that is a commercial product from JetBrains.  I also like PyCharm and IntelliJ from JetBrains.

The 'cheatsheets-xml-test-data' comes from another open source project I worked on and they are best viewed inside Eclipse.

Eclipse is a more general purpose IDE written mainly in Java.
