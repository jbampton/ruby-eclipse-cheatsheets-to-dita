# Eclipse cheat sheets (XML) to DITA with Ruby, XSL, Nokogiri

This project uses Ruby, XSLT, XPath and the Nokogiri gem to transform custom XML (Eclipse cheat sheets) into DITA.

The 'cheatsheets-xml-test-data' are best viewed inside Eclipse, and are used as input when 'default.rb' runs.

The Ruby file 'default.rb' builds the output parent Ditamap 'map.ditamap' (output/map.ditamap) and the 4 sub dita tasks in the 'output/dita' folder.

The XSL code is embedded inside Ruby as well as some XML markup in an interpolated Heredoc syntax.

The project uses Ruby to create the ditamap and Ruby and Nokogiri XSLT to create the sub task files.

Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) is an XML data model for authoring and using DITA-OT you can publish those ideas.

The DITA standard is maintained by the OASIS DITA Technical Committee.

I used RubyMine and OS X for development.  RubyMine is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Ruby and Rails projects and has Git functionality built in.

RubyMine is a very advanced code editor that is a commercial product from JetBrains.  I also like PyCharm and IntelliJ from JetBrains.

Eclipse is a more general purpose IDE written mainly in Java.
